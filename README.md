This game is created for a school summative assignment by Nathan, Yousif, and Taemin.

Description of the Game:

This program is a player vs player turn based battle game that revolves around fighters who are called “Legends” to battle each other until every legend in that player’s team is eliminated.

The maximum number of legends a player can have in a team is three, and they may choose whoever they want, as long as it is not already taken by the other player. Be aware of which type of legend you choose because each type can be super effective or not very effective against one another (or neutral).
